No one converts *from* dollars or RMB *to* Bitcoin to get something's cost in BTC.\n\nWe aren't at the point where the value of ‚Çø1.00 is thought of as ‚Çø1.00 the way $1.00 is $1.00 or ¬•1.00 is ¬•1.00. Right now, everyone thinks of Bitcoin's value in terms of other real currencies. In that sense, it's treated more like a stock than a currency - except its value is based solely on speculation.","body_html":"<div class = \"md\"> <p> –î–∞, –Ω–æ –Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Å –±–∏—Ç–∫–æ–π–Ω–∞–º–∏. –ù–∏–∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –∫–æ–Ω–≤–µ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç <em> –∏–∑ </em> –¥–æ–ª–ª–∞—Ä–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ <RM> <em> –≤ </em> –±–∏—Ç–∫–æ–π–Ω—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫—É—é-—Ç–æ —Å—Ç–æ–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ BTC. </P>\n\n<p> –ú—ã –Ω–µ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—Å—è –≤ —Ç–æ–π —Ç–æ—á–∫–µ, –≥–¥–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ 1,00 —Ñ—É–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ —Å—Ç–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω–≥–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ 1,00 —Ñ—É–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ —Å—Ç–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω–≥–æ–≤, —Ç–æ–≥–¥–∞ –∫–∞–∫ 1,00 –¥–æ–ª–ª. –°–®–ê —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç 1,00 –¥–æ–ª–ª. –°–®–ê –∏–ª–∏ 1,00 –∏–µ–Ω 1,00 ¬• 1,00. –°–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ –¥—É–º–∞—é—Ç –æ —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ë–∏—Ç–∫–æ–π–Ω–∞ —Å —Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∞–ª—é—Ç. –í —ç—Ç–æ–º —Å–º—ã—Å–ª–µ –æ–Ω —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–∫–æ—Ä–µ–µ –∫–∞–∫ –∞–∫—Ü–∏—è, —á–µ–º –≤–∞–ª—é—Ç–∞, –∑–∞ –∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º —Ç–æ–≥–æ, —á—Ç–æ –µ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–æ–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–ø–µ–∫—É–ª—è—Ü–∏–∏. </P>\n</DIV>","permalink":"/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/c1zlny/the_true_power_of_bitcoin/erhgccl/","name":"t1_erhgccl","created":1560903546,"created_utc":1560874746,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/CryptoCurrency","depth":2}],"id":"erh9vck","author":"kescusay","parent_id":"t3_c1zlny","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","body":"Great.
