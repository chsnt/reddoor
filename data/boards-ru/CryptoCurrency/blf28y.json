Stiglitz his books, and has watched countless lectures, I feel obligated to say that most comments here (not all) are extremely misguided. Before you down-vote, *please* hear me out.\n\nFirst of all, J. Stiglitz is not just another economist or banker. He is a world-renowned economist who has taken very admirable positions regarding the current financial system, most of them relate to why we no longer believe in it, and most of you would strongly agree with these positions for sure. Speaking from experience, he is one of the few economists (like T. Piketty, or P. Krugman) who is actually more interested in raising the average life-quality for the working people in the world, and is strongly against concentration of means, power and wealth into the hands of a small number of people or financial entities. I guarantee you that this person has done more in his life to challenge the broken financial sector, and all of it's fraudulent activities, then any of us ever will. I mean just think about some of the titles of his best-selling books \"*The Price of Inequality*\" or \"*The Three Trillion Dollar War\"* or \"*Making Globalization Work\".*\n\nSecondly, he is the first to admit that the current financial system is completely and utterly broken. He believes banks have only 1 aspect that is of any use to the economy, as an intermediary, to provide a payments network. Which should -according to him- should be almost *free of charge*. All it's other activities such as speculation, inflationary lending (I must add, for asset-inflation, he does consider inflation for productive purposes a good thing for the economy, but not for house-loans for instance, or any other type of \"non-productive lending\"), lobbying, ... are disregarded by him as immoral, and a drag on the -what is sometimes called - \"the real economy\", not the financial fairy-dust/magic numbers economy. For decades, long before any of us had heard of Bitcoin, this man has been screaming from the rooftops that the current financial sector is utterly insane and that it doesn't serve the interests of the vast majority of people, bitterly condemning the bank bailouts for example.\n\nThirdly, no words should be put into his mouth. His only real objection I've heard is the lack of transparency (i.e. Monero/Zcash). Where nobody would be able to trace anything. From *his* perspective, I strongly agree with this statement. *BUT* his perspective is that governments are not that infiltrated by the powers that be. That governments will still act in the name of it's people. If we would all be living in properly functioning democracies I believe that giving the state this transparency can be very beneficial to all of ours lives. But, this is where he and I, and most you, differ. I no longer trust my government to act in my interests. I mean, if my government allows elites to have Swiss bank-accounts, and I can get one aswel, then I will. After all, I'm the one in need of more protection, not them.\n\nFourth, notice that in his statements refer to *elites* (paradise papers, money laundering, ... ) stashing away their wealth in these *\"dark havens*\". He sees crypto as an additional means for *this* to be accomplished. He didn't refer to the every day person, and that's not a coincidence to any person who has read one of his books. Yes, he does believe the US Dollar is a good currency. And by historical standards, he is absolutely right (we see Bitcoin as digital gold, well, the USD was pegged to physical gold for a very long time too). The US Dollar has survived extremely well, compared to the thousands of other fiat-currencies in history, that all went to 0.\n\nFurthermore, listen to what he actually said : *\"If we want a more efficient economy without these illicit activities, I think we're going to have to move to more of an electronic payment mechanism, and we will have to figure out a way to have the transparency without the dangers of the surveillance and the surveillance state.\"* I mean, he probably doesn't know it, but he is arguing for a lot of the same things we're arguing for...\n\nHe believes the dollar can start working for everyone of us (by regulating the private sector again -just like we used to have during our best economic growth, or the Bretton Woods system, *and have central banks answer to governments once again* \\- which they obviously no longer need to do), just like it did in the 60's and 70's, when it did! So, his positions are *A LOT* more nuanced then they appear in this video.\n\nFifth, I'm not sure whether he understands the political aspect of cryptocurrencies, the governance-side of it. It's pretty obvious that he doesn't because he thinks cryptocurrencies can be shut down (lol). But I find it hard to believe he would be against a currency that is directly or indirectly ruled by the majority of people. This is just speculation on my part, but I've read his books. The idea of direct governance by voting or mining or some other mechanism is something that I think he would support. He just still believes central banks and governments are more fit to carry out the task of making a currency work for everybody, and not just all-powerful financial entities. *And that is where our opinions differ.*\n\nSo, I'm not at all convinced J. Stiglitz should be put on our \"enemy-list\". My take-away is that a famous brilliant academic argued for many things cryptocurrency has to offer. Yes, while still being rather naïve and uninformed about the inner workings of it all. Furthermore, nowhere is it written that the majority of people can't support a transparent cryptocurrency. If the general population/consensus is that states should be given the transparency of our money-flows. Then that will happen you know... this is crypto... we have the hard-fork. Our own consensus can dictate the shape and form our means of payment should take.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThose here interested in renowned economists should check out prof. *\"Richard Werner\"*. He's the academic that provided the first empirical evidence, in 2014, that individual private banks create currency out of thin-air. I find it stunning that nobody in the crypto space knows his name, while he's probably our biggest academic champion of all time. The research can be found here: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070). His book \"*Princes of the Yen\"* will blow all of your minds.\n\nWatch the documentary here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap\\_MAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap_MAY)\n\nSpoiler alert: did you know one district in Tokyo was, once upon a time, worth as much as the entire state of California (on papermoney) ? And the city of Tokyo as much as Canada, the nation (on papermoney) ?

Стиглица и посмотрел бесчисленные лекции, я чувствую себя обязанным сказать, что большинство комментариев здесь (не все) крайне ошибочны. Прежде чем вы проголосуете, <em>, пожалуйста, </em> выслушайте меня. </P>\n\n<p> Прежде всего, Дж. Стиглиц - не просто еще один экономист или банкир. Он является всемирно известным экономистом, занявшим весьма замечательные позиции в отношении нынешней финансовой системы, большинство из которых связаны с тем, почему мы больше не верим в это, и большинство из вас наверняка полностью согласится с этими позициями. Исходя из опыта, он является одним из немногих экономистов (таких как Т. Пикетти или П. Кругман), которые на самом деле больше заинтересованы в повышении среднего качества жизни трудящихся в мире и решительно против концентрации средств, власть и богатство в руках небольшого числа людей или финансовых организаций. Я гарантирую вам, что этот человек сделал больше в своей жизни, чтобы бросить вызов разбитому финансовому сектору и всей его мошеннической деятельности, чем когда-либо из нас. Я имею в виду просто подумайте о некоторых из названий его самых продаваемых книг \"<em> Цена неравенства </em>\" или \"<em> Война за три триллиона долларов\" </em> или \"<em> Создание глобализации\". Работа». </EM> </P>\n\n<p> Во-вторых, он первый, кто признает, что нынешняя финансовая система полностью разрушена. Он считает, что у банков есть только один аспект, который может быть полезен экономике в качестве посредника для создания платежной сети. Что, по его словам, должно быть почти <em> бесплатным </em>. Все это другие виды деятельности, такие как спекуляция, инфляционное кредитование (я должен добавить, что для инфляции активов он считает инфляцию в производственных целях благом для экономики, но не для жилищных кредитов, например, или для любого другого типа \"продуктивное кредитование\"), лоббирование, ... он игнорирует как аморальное, и затягивает, что иногда называют, \"реальную экономику\", а не финансовую фею / пыль / экономику магических чисел. В течение десятилетий, задолго до того, как кто-либо из нас слышал о Биткойне, этот человек с крыш кричал, что нынешний финансовый сектор совершенно безумен и что он не отвечает интересам подавляющего большинства людей, горько осуждая спасение банков например. </p>\n\n<p> В-третьих, нельзя произносить слова в рот. Его единственное реальное возражение, которое я слышал, это отсутствие прозрачности (то есть Monero / Zcash). Где никто не сможет ничего отследить. С <em> его </em> точки зрения, я полностью согласен с этим утверждением. <em> НО </em> он считает, что правительства не настолько проникнуты существующими силами. То, что правительства по-прежнему будут действовать во имя своих людей. Если бы мы все жили в правильно функционирующих демократиях, я считаю, что предоставление государству такой прозрачности может быть очень полезным для всей нашей жизни. Но это то, чем он и я, и большинство из вас, отличаются. Я больше не верю, что мое правительство действует в моих интересах. Я имею в виду, что если мое правительство разрешит элитам иметь швейцарские банковские счета, и я смогу получить один авель, тогда я это сделаю. В конце концов, я нуждаюсь в большей защите, а не они. </P>\n\n<p> В-четвертых, обратите внимание, что в его заявлениях говорится о <em> элитах </em> (райские газеты, отмывание денег, ...), скрывающих свое богатство в этих <em> \"темных убежищах </em>\". Он видит криптографию как дополнительное средство для достижения <em> этого </em>. Он не имел в виду повседневного человека, и это не случайно ни одному человеку, который прочитал одну из его книг. Да, он действительно считает доллар США хорошей валютой. И по историческим меркам, он абсолютно прав (мы рассматриваем Биткойн как цифровое золото, ну, доллар тоже привязан к физическому золоту в течение очень долгого времени). Доллар США выжил чрезвычайно хорошо, по сравнению с тысячами других фиатных валют в истории, которые все пошли на 0. </P>\n\n<p> Кроме того, послушайте, что он на самом деле сказал: <em> «Если мы хотим более эффективной экономики без этих незаконных действий, я думаю, что нам придется перейти к большему количеству механизма электронных платежей, и у нас будет чтобы придумать способ добиться прозрачности, не подвергая опасности наблюдение и состояние наблюдения ». Я имею в виду, что он, вероятно, этого не знает, но он спорит о многом из того, что мы спорить за ... </p>\n\n<p> Он считает, что доллар может начать работать для каждого из нас (снова регулируя частный сектор - точно так же, как мы привыкли иметь при нашем лучшем экономическом росте или в бреттон-вудской системе <em>, и чтобы центральные банки отвечали правительствам еще раз </em> - что им, очевидно, больше не нужно делать), как это было в 60-х и 70-х годах, когда это было! Таким образом, его позиции <em> НАМНОГО </em> более нюансов, чем они появляются в этом видео. </P>\n\n<p> В-пятых, я не уверен, понимает ли он политический аспект криптовалюты, сторону управления. Совершенно очевидно, что он этого не делает, потому что думает, что криптовалюты могут быть закрыты (смеется). Но мне трудно поверить, что он был бы против валюты, которой прямо или косвенно управляет большинство людей. Это всего лишь предположение с моей стороны, но я читал его книги. Я думаю, что он поддержит идею прямого управления с помощью голосования, майнинга или какого-то другого механизма. Он просто все еще верит, что центральные банки и правительства в большей степени способны выполнить задачу заставить валюту работать для всех, а не только для всех могущественных финансовых организаций. <em> И именно здесь наши мнения расходятся. </em> </p>\n\n<p> Итак, я совсем не убежден, что Дж. Стиглиц должен быть включен в наш «список врагов». Мое мнение о том, что криптовалюта может предложить известный гениальный академик за многие вещи. Да, все еще будучи довольно наивным и не информированным о внутренней работе всего этого. Кроме того, нигде не написано, что большинство людей не может поддерживать прозрачную криптовалюту. Если население в целом / консенсус в том, что государствам следует предоставить прозрачность наших денежных потоков. Тогда это произойдет, вы знаете ... это крипто ... у нас есть хард-форк. Наш собственный консенсус может определять форму и форму, которую должны принимать наши платежные средства. </P>\n\n<Р> EDIT: </p>\n\n<p> Те, кто интересуется известными экономистами, должны посетить проф. <em> \"Ричард Вернер\" </em>. Он академик, который представил первые эмпирические доказательства, в 2014 году, что отдельные частные банки создают валюту из воздуха. Я нахожу поразительным, что никто в крипто-пространстве не знает его имени, хотя он, вероятно, наш самый большой академический чемпион всех времен.

He has been continuously critical of ‘laissez-faire’ public policy and calls macroeconomists who advocate that ‘free-market fundamentalists’. His comments against cryptocurrencies appear to be driven from his dislike of public policy that gives free-rein to transactions and the way cryptocurrencies enable decentralized transactions free from the control and intervention of a centralized authority. Actually, I am a fan of Joseph Stiglitz and Dr Meera Singh. If you don't know Dr Meera Singh, she is the CEO of the best healthcare project called [Afrihealth](https://www.afri-health.com/?utm_source=cc-em1).
