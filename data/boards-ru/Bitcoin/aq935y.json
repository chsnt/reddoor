Not sure if that was true or not.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/aq935y/el_chapo_will_most_likely_get_less_time_than_ross/egepg46/","name":"t1_egepg46","created":1550119343,"created_utc":1550090543,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":4,"link_id":"t3_aq935y","id":"egeyeml","author":"Akoustyk","parent_id":"t3_aq935y","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"That list looks like a list of people that cooperated with police and got off easy because of it, and the head of the whole thing got what he deserved. \n\nI don't think this looks like Ross should have a more lenient sentence, but everyone else should have had a harsher one. \n\nI can only guess it must be because they gave information that helped them convict Ross, or find him or both, as well as tip themmoff to all sorts of other things for the operation. \n\nThat would let law enforcement put a bigger sent in their operations, rather than just put one guy in jail, and have him replaced immediately.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That list looks like a list of people that cooperated with police and got off easy because of it, and the head of the whole thing got what he deserved. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think this looks like Ross should have a more lenient sentence, but everyone else should have had a harsher one. </p>\n\n<p>I can only guess it must be because they gave information that helped them convict Ross, or find him or both, as well as tip themmoff to all sorts of other things for the operation. </p>\n\n<p>That would let law enforcement put a bigger sent in their operations, rather than just put one guy in jail, and have him replaced immediately.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/aq935y/el_chapo_will_most_likely_get_less_time_than_ross/egeyeml/","name":"t1_egeyeml","created":1550125228,"created_utc":1550096428,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":4,"link_id":"t3_aq935y","id":"egf5yir","author":"ImRedditNow","parent_id":"t3_aq935y","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"1.
