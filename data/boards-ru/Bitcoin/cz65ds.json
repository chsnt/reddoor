But I&#39;m not satisfied through bitcoin. That&#39;s why I&#39;m using another type of cryptocurrency that is on the  roll these days. This currency name is &quot;LEDU&quot;.  The LEDU  token issued on the Ethereum platform. Moreover, it has a  circulating supply of 218 Million coins.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/cz65ds/why_bitcoin/f0li3yo/","name":"t1_f0li3yo","created":1568747758,"created_utc":1568718958,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_cz65ds","id":"f0w8c1y","author":"Balls_Deeper","parent_id":"t3_cz65ds","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"Pseudonymous.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Pseudonymous.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/cz65ds/why_bitcoin/f0w8c1y/","name":"t1_f0w8c1y","created":1569030143,"created_utc":1569001343,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_cz65ds","id":"f6ue1gu","author":"LolNowWhat","parent_id":"t3_cz65ds","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"true","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>true</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/cz65ds/why_bitcoin/f6ue1gu/","name":"t1_f6ue1gu","created":1573190415,"created_utc":1573161615,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_cz65ds","id":"eywmrz6","author":"Envir0","parent_id":"t3_cz65ds","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"And, depending on which one dislikes you, no bank will serve you.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>And, depending on which one dislikes you, no bank will serve you.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/Bitcoin/comments/cz65ds/why_bitcoin/eywmrz6/","name":"t1_eywmrz6","created":1567561881,"created_utc":1567533081,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Bitcoin","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_cz65ds","id":"eywqjnj","author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_cz65ds","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","body":"Bitcoin?

The reason fiat is great is because there are a lot of institutions in place that can act as an authority and help you store, lend, borrow, invest, and protect money. For example, I pay someone $100 but they don’t give me the item I bought off of them or it’s defective. I now have no recourse because there’s no authoritative entity that can help me recoup my funds in the case of fraud and the recipient can run with the money. By the time we get cryptocurrency to the same level of infrastructure as fiat, there will be little distinction and it’ll make you wonder what made you love Bitcoin in the first place. There are too many players in major fiat currencies that will let it get devalued. So fuck “freedom” with my cash given this limitation. Bitcoin is nothing more than a black market currency.
