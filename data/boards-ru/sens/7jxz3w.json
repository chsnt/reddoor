Ballet was my everything.  But being in such a body-focused sport mixed with perfectionism and anxiety, I began a deadly dance with an eating disorder.  After struggling for 10 years and almost losing my life to my eating disorder, I recovered and founded The Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness in the year 2000.  I started The Alliance because I wanted people to have the support that I didn’t have when I was struggling. I wanted people to know that **full recovery is 100% possible.**\n\nEating disorders are not a choice. I did not wake up one morning and say, “Hey I think I’m going to struggle with Anorexia today.”  They are a deadly, biopsychosocial illnesses. **Every 62 minutes someone dies as a direct result of their eating disorder.** Throughout my 17 years running The Alliance, I have seen many people lose their battle.  But I have also seen many people get better and go on to graduate from college, get married, and have children. I have seen people go from barely surviving to flourishing and thriving. \n\nI have so many hopes and aspirations for The Alliance. Every year we grow a little bit more and are able to widen our impact on the community.  Since our inception, we have spoken to more than 290,000 people, both nationally and internationally.  The Alliance offers comprehensive services including: educational presentations to schools, healthcare providers’ offices and hospitals, treatment centers, and community agencies.  We are heavily involved in advocacy and helped pass the first eating disorder legislation in history.  We are a bridge between those struggling and clinicians and treatment centers who are there to help. We created a non-pay-to-play, all inclusive site that helps connect people to those resources. \n\nI often think about how many people who are going to change the world are lost to this disease. **30 million Americans will struggle with an eating disorder sometime in their life.  That’s 1 in 10 people.**  We sincerely hope you consider helping us, so we can help change their world and give them hope that recovery is possible. \n","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I started dancing when I was 3 years old.
