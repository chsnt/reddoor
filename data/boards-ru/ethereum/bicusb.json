These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.\n\n### Golden Rule\n\nYou are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:\n\n* Personal insults\n* Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks\n* Slurs of any kind\n* Posting people’s private information\n\nIf you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.\n\n### Ether Price, Market, and Mining discussions\n\nDiscussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on [/r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader), a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. Besides, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as [/r/EtherMining](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining) and obvious ICO advertisements to [r/ethinvestor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethinvestor) or similar.\n\n### Duplicate threads\n\nDuplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.\n\n### No spamming or drive by posting\n\nSpamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no *drive by posting*.\n\n### Using multiple accounts\n\nCreating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.\n\n### Misleading titles\n\nPosts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.\n\n### Karma & age requirements for posting submissions\n\nAll post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis; please do not message the mods for more information.\n\n## Moderation philosophy\n\n[/r/ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum) is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the conversation stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.\n\n### What we ask our users\n\n* Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built-in moderation tool that is very powerful.\n* If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.\n* Please don’t report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that break the rules.\n* We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [\"All Ethereum\" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).\n\n### Moderation logs\n\nThe moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log).\n\n## FAQ\n\n* [How would I **explain Ethereum** to a non-technical friend?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/45)\n* [What are the Ethereum **disk space needs**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/143)\n* [What is **\"gas\"** and **transaction fee** in Ethereum?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3)\n* [What is the **total supply** of Ether?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/443)\n* [Help with **very slow Mist sync**!](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/603)\n* [How to **backup** mist wallets?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/946)\n* [How do I **backup** my ether accounts?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/108)\n* [What is the recommended way to **safely store Ether**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1239)\n* [How to **reduce the chances** of your Ethereum wallet **getting hacked**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/3887)\n* [How do I **buy Ethereum** with USD?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/1915)\n* [How can I get a Geth node to **download the blockchain quickly**?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/392)\n* [**How to mine** Ether on GNU + Linux?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/111)\n* [**Ropsten** testnet is under kind of attack?
