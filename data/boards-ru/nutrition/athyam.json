Но для микробиома они невероятны. Сначала поймите, как важен устойчивый крахмал для микробиома.\n\nhttps://www.dermveda.com/articles/why-you-should-eat-resistant-starch-for-a-healthy-microbiome\n\n> Устойчивый крахмал метаболизируется микробами в кишечнике с образованием молекул, называемых короткоцепочечными жирными кислотами, такими как ацетат, бутират и пропионат. Эти жирные кислоты с короткой цепью имеют значительные преимущества для здоровья, в том числе противораковые и противовоспалительные эффекты. [4,5] Диеты с высоким содержанием резистентного крахмала приводят к повышению уровня жирных кислот с короткой цепью и могут обеспечивать защиту от воспаления и заболеваний толстой кишки. [ 6] Пищевые волокна, которые ферментируются нашими кишечными микроорганизмами, называются «пребиотиками», что приводит к выработке полезных короткоцепочечных жирных кислот и других молекул, включая серотонин и дезоксихолевую кислоту. [7,8]\n\n> Употребление резистентного крахмала может даже улучшить проблемы с регуляцией инсулина, включая резистентность к инсулину и диабет. [9]\n\nhttps://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/en/new-review-explores-latest-knowledge-resistant-starch-nutrition-modulator-gut-microbiota/\n\n> Кроме того, RS (резистентный крахмал) оказывает специфическое благотворное влияние на кишечную среду, включая увеличение популяции Ruminococcus bromii - доминирующего члена типа Firmicutes, который играет основную роль в высвобождении энергии из пищевых крахмалов, которые избегают переваривания ферментами хозяина через его Исключительная активность против устойчивых к частицам крахмалов. Кроме того, было показано, что употребление в пищу продуктов, богатых РС, увеличивает уровни жирных кислот в короткой цепи в люминах, модулирует микробный метаболизм и улучшает маркеры гомеостаза глюкозы и чувствительности к инсулину.\n\n> Что касается клеточных сигнальных путей, которые могут объяснить физиологические эффекты РС, то на животных моделях было хорошо документировано, что ** устойчивый крахмал обладает сильными противовоспалительными свойствами **\n\nИ бобы, несомненно, лучший источник резистентного крахмала в нашем рационе. У них намного больше РС, чем у любой другой обычно съедаемой пищи. Смотрите здесь для получения дополнительной информации.\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/16/ask-the-expert-legumes-and-resistant-starch/\n\nУпотребление в пищу бобов может даже изменить микробиом таким образом, чтобы убить раковые клетки!\n\nhttps://www.healio.com/gastroenterology/oncology/news/online/%7B1d9afc8b-cef1-4b45-94bc-61dbfc08144b%7D/rice-bran-navy-beans-boost-gut-microbiome-slow-crc-cell -growth\n\n> Чтобы оценить химиопрофилактические эффекты потребления рисовых отрубей и морских бобов, Райан и его коллеги провели пилотное исследование 2-й фазы (испытание BENEFIT), в котором они случайным образом распределили 29 выживших CRC, чтобы они потребляли 30 граммов рисовых отрубей в день, 35 граммов порошок фасоли в день или ни в течение 4 недель.\n\n> Они обнаружили, что увеличение потребления рисовых отрубей и бобов военно-морского флота приводило к повышению уровня пищевых волокон, железа, цинка, тиамина, ниацина, витамина В6, фолата и альфа-токоферола. Кроме того, анализ микробиома кала показал, что группа рисовых отрубей имела повышенное микробное богатство и разнообразие кишечника, а группа морских бобов показала повышенное микробное богатство кишечника.\n\n> Примечательно, что анализ экстрактов метаболитов стула человека до и после диетического вмешательства показал увеличение потребления рисовых отрубей или морских бобов и снижение роста колоректальных раковых клеток.\n\nЕсть еще кое-что, но это все, что я сейчас опубликую.","title":"Фасоль может быть самой лучшей вещью, которую вы можете съесть для своего микробиома.
