No one is saying that their diets were optimal but indigenous societies today that live traditional lifestyles and eat traditional diets show remarkably low rates of many chronic illnesses that western societies suffer from in massive percentages. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028773/\n\n\n\n>Background—Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at\nleast 90% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association\nbetween the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, **we examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering,\nfishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden.**\n\n\n\n>596 (85%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13%) had CAC\nscores of 1–100, and 20 (3%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75\nyears, 31 (65%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8%) had CAC scores of\n100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p≤0-0001 for all age\ncategories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2.35 mmol/L (91\nmg/dL) and 1.0 mmol/L (39.5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and\nregular cigarette smoking were rare. \n\n\n>Interpretation—**Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.\nThese findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a\nlifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no\nsmoking, and plenty of physical activity.

No one is saying that their diets were optimal but indigenous societies today that live traditional lifestyles and eat traditional diets show remarkably low rates of many chronic illnesses that western societies suffer from in massive percentages. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028773/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028773/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Background—Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at\nleast 90% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association\nbetween the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, <strong>we examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering,\nfishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden.</strong></p>\n\n<p>596 (85%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13%) had CAC\nscores of 1–100, and 20 (3%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75\nyears, 31 (65%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8%) had CAC scores of\n100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p≤0-0001 for all age\ncategories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2.35 mmol/L (91\nmg/dL) and 1.0 mmol/L (39.5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and\nregular cigarette smoking were rare. </p>\n\n<p>Interpretation—<strong>Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.\nThese findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a\nlifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no\nsmoking, and plenty of physical activity.

While reading your post, I couldn't help but reflect on the numerous dieting fads that target this ideal, engraining it into their marketing theme and demonizing anything with additives, artificial ingredients, or any degree of processing. While I think an effort to eat entirely wholesome foods, in all of their unprocessed glory, sounds moderately miserable and likely unfeasible, I must acknowledge the intended benefits this way of eating would offer. One would be able to access loads of nutrients, avoid excessive sugar consumption, increase fiber intake and digestive health, promote a healthy blood sugar level, and improve gut health. Many of these aforementioned highlights being root causative factors in today's society filled with chronic disease. *However....*I'm calling bogus. I'm calling out diet culture for what it is here. Another ploy to wave fancy ideals of the perfect diet in the faces of vulnerable people. Yes, whole and unprocessed foods should be the foundation, and the majority component, of every diet. But in today's world, it is not a grounded ambition. It seems to me to be another way to thrust food rules, guilt, and shame on our already diet-focused society. \n\nI shudder at my own repetition of cliche, but moderation is everything. Incorporating processed foods into one's diet is not the end of the world, and not inherently \"unhealthy\". For one, processed foods are, as far as modern technology and data suggests, healthy. They are thoroughly tested and vetted for toxins and the like. They are treated to remove bacteria and other harmful agents. Furthermore, they are an essential resource for individuals facing devastating disaster. These so-labelled evil foods can also be nutritionally sound. Certain food processing protocols actually seal in key nutrients right after harvesting delivering essential compounds directly to you with an extended shelf-life thanks to modern technology On that note, they are also often fortified with vitamins, minerals, and fiber to further boost the nutritional profile of the food. Finally, processed foods are convenient. A statement that would cause a downright riot among nutrition gurus and paleo-enthusiasts alike. \n\nMy point being, we need to stop demonizing and glorifying foods. They have no moral value. A diet based on whole foods does promote healthful living, but one that *incorporates* processed foods is not *bad*. In many instances it can enhance a wholesome diet, making it more well-rounded. In direct response to your posed question, I think it is a silly idea to want to eat like our ancestors. Mainly because we don't have to! We have the delicious, health-promoting foods that our ancestors had, and we have the delicious, health-promoting foods that *we* created.

I agree with a lot of what Chris Kresser says, and if more people ate that way, the world would be a healthier place.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here&#39;s a link to that information: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021051/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021051/</a></p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/dh62rm/why_do_we_aspire_to_eat_like_our_ancestors/f3n8ysv/","name":"t1_f3n8ysv","created":1571024744,"created_utc":1570995944,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":2}],"id":"f3m9tdz","author":"wild_vegan","parent_id":"t3_dh62rm","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"As you can see, this is a contentious subject. Even I'll argue about it, lol, and I would hope that we can do better than ancient people.\n\nMost of the Paleo arguments you hear are wrong. Cordain was biased towards people living in harsh environments and eating meat heavy diets. The original papers by Konner, Eaton, and Cordain settled on a diet that was only 6% calories from saturated fat and had 104 grams of fiber. Yet, the idea of primitive eating has been used to justify diets that are full of low-fiber, high-saturated fat modern meats.\n\nBut that's the utility of these arguments. You can point to some tribe, say they were healthy eating this or that, and then say we should be eating like that. In many cases its downright wrong. The Inuit had plenty of atherosclerosis and so did the Masai. People go through all sorts of mental gymnastics to say that wasn't the case when those are clearly the facts. But when I pull out the Yanomami in Brazil, who don't eat salt, I get downvotes. The reason is that it's just psychological justification, a kind of religion, and not a scientific point of view. There's one idiot in Austria who claimed that Roman gladiators were fat, because they ate barley, and obviously carbs make you fat. You'd think they'd want to avoid GrainBrain so they could stay agile, but for some reason it wasn't a problem. ;)\n\nIt's a terrible idea to eat processed food, which everybody agrees we didn't evolve to eat, and which is made specifically so we spend money on it. But other than that diets should be supported by modern scientific evidence. I don't think there's anything wrong with using evolution or anthropology for hypothesis formation, though. Neanderthals ate beans, and modern science confirms that beans are an incredible healthy food. ;)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As you can see, this is a contentious subject.
