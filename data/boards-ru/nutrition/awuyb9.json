Я как бы избегал его культового аспекта и ел в основном куриные салаты (курица, ромейн, авокадо, яйца вкрутую, сыр из перца), а также мясо, такое как лосось или курица с брокколи, цветной капустой или брюссельской капустой. Закуски включали сырные палочки, ломтики огурца, ложку арахисового масла перед сном.\n\nВ итоге я потерял 30 фунтов, но я все больше и больше исследовал и принимал решение об этой диете, и я знаю, что не хочу делать это вечно, и я не хочу поддерживать такой стиль диеты.\n\nЯ приобрел хорошие привычки в этой диете - избегая обработанных продуктов, таких как печенье, чипсы (были серьезные проблемы с перееданием), - и пища, такая как лосось или курица с овощной стороной, звучит все еще довольно здорово, верно? Я мог бы также хотеть есть меньше мяса (я был вегетарианцем некоторое время).\n\nЯ просто хочу включить фрукты, киноа, коричневый рис и иметь возможность наслаждаться кусочком пиццы время от времени, не сходя с ума.\n\nМоя главная проблема в том, что я не знаю, что делать дальше. Кето упростил мне задачу, это было похоже на следование игровой системе. Я открыт для любых предложений.","title":"Покидая кето.

The result is basically that foods that aren't so great for you OR need to be eaten in moderation have high points values.

Maybe it doesn&#39;t look that great anyway? Both are real options, and the almost inevitable result is that you will only chose the cake rarely, and really enjoy it consciously when you do. It sounds logical, but for me... I never really knew how to structure that trade-off or evaluate food. It also is completely viable for maintenance (basically, you go from 23 points a day to 26), so its not something you have to yo-yo with or go on and off. Its very stable. </p>\n\n<p>For someone (else) like me who really needs that structure of a more defined program but also would like the flexibility of not calling foods &quot;off limits forever&quot; but doesn&#39;t yet know how to balance them in moderation, WW is awesome.   </p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/awuyb9/leaving_keto_want_to_start_a_balanced_diet/ehspp86/","name":"t1_ehspp86","created":1551765607,"created_utc":1551736807,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_awuyb9","id":"ei4zp45","author":"antwon2008","parent_id":"t3_awuyb9","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"judgement free zone hahaha seriously","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>judgement free zone hahaha seriously</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/awuyb9/leaving_keto_want_to_start_a_balanced_diet/ei4zp45/","name":"t1_ei4zp45","created":1552168096,"created_utc":1552139296,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_awuyb9","id":"ehpfvk8","author":"teamobliterator","parent_id":"t3_awuyb9","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"I hate to be repetitive, but IF and count your calories.
