Прочитайте это!\n\nРедактировать 3: Так много людей говорят, что единственная причина - это вкус. Вкус, однако, это просто наше тело, говорящее нам о том, что полезно для нас (как указано в моем первоначальном комментарии), поэтому вопрос был в том, ПОЧЕМУ они так вкусны. Имейте в виду, что такие вещи, как сахар, являются показателем высококалорийной еды, даже если рафинированный сахар сам по себе не так уж полезен для нас.\n\nРедактировать 4: Еще один отличный угол от U / UpSaltOs","title":"Лук и чеснок есть практически в каждом рецепте, независимо от культуры.
