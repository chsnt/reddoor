I might grab a soup or sandwich from the cafeteria, but if I do, I usually skip my snack later.\n\nSnack - banana and peanut butter(small amt!); cottage cheese cup with fruit; yogurt and granola; apple and nuts; cheese/crackers; handful of PB pretzels.\n\nAfter Gym - immediately come home and have a few slices of cheese or a handful of carrots as I prepare food.\n\nDinner - (I'll give you this week) Big ass salad that is less salad and more smorgasbord of veggies (beans, corn, carrots, tofu, leftover veg); Fish and tomato onion salad; Baked potato and tomato onion salad with mozz and tofu; Thai Quinoa Casserole with veggies.

My appetite has remained the same, but now I only eat twice a day. No breakfast - Just lunch at 12, dinner at 7. I've been picky about what I eat. My diet has stayed largely vegetarian.

I probably eat meat/seafood twice a week and eggs twice a week.\n\nMy body just finds it incredibly hard to put on weight. When I was 17, I got a **really** bad stomach infection and lost ~20 pounds in a month (120lb to 100lb).

Sometimes indulge in midnight tortilla chip snacks, eat ice cream often. Bake brownies often.\nOne fruit a day on average.\n\nDrinks: water, sparkling water, sometimes some gatorade. Never soda.

I had one of the largest appetites in my class in school. During my teens I was constantly hungry. 4 large meals everyday. </p>\n\n<p>For the last 3-4 years, things have changed. My appetite has remained the same, but now I only eat twice a day. No breakfast - Just lunch at 12, dinner at 7. I&#39;ve been picky about what I eat. My diet has stayed largely vegetarian. I love seafood (fried/baked fish, fish curry, shrimp). I don&#39;t really enjoy meat (except kebabs, pepperoni pizza, chicken satay and turkey deli). I probably eat meat/seafood twice a week and eggs twice a week.</p>\n\n<p>My body just finds it incredibly hard to put on weight. When I was 17, I got a <strong>really</strong> bad stomach infection and lost ~20 pounds in a month (120lb to 100lb). It took me almost 6 months to recover the lost weight.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t follow any diet, but I avoid red meat, added sugar, soda, too much cheese, packaged/processed food (everything that makes food American).</p>\n\n<p>My staples are:\n(For eating out) deli sandwiches (a simple turkey and lettuce/tomato/avocado sandwich), rice bowls with tofu, or shrimp, chipotle, maybe some thin crust pizza sometimes.\n(Eating at home) rice with vegetable curry and lentils, pasta with veggies and/or eggs, or boiled/scrambled eggs/omlettes with bread, lots of Maruchan ramen, </p>\n\n<p>I snack on cashews, almonds, pistachios at work. Sometimes indulge in midnight tortilla chip snacks, eat ice cream often. Bake brownies often.\nOne fruit a day on average.</p>\n\n<p>Drinks: water, sparkling water, sometimes some gatorade. Never soda. Maybe some tea or coffee (not a habit).</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/czupup/people_who_have_been_thin_their_whole_lives_whats/ez42ta1/","name":"t1_ez42ta1","created":1567708776,"created_utc":1567679976,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_czupup","id":"ez44d92","author":"gib_loops","parent_id":"t3_czupup","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"Been lean my whole life, genetics most likely played a role there, but also:\nnever ate fast food, had soda a few times a year for birthdays and stuff, all food is home cooked, lots of vegetables and fruits but we do eat meat almost every day, don't eat much sweets as i don't like them but whenever i want chocolate I'll have it.

Meaning at the grocery store I buy primarily fruits, vegetables, meats, spices and oils. I think some people would not consider oils whole, but they seem to work for me. For Matt's I usually choose seafood and fowl over red meat, but I probably eat red meat once every 1-2 weeks, usually when it's the only thing on the menu that looks good it I just get a craving.  Some really common meals I eat..\n\n- Chipotle salad with fajita peppers, chicken, salsa and guac.\n\n- salmon marinated in basil pesto with greens beans sauteed in Olive oil and garlic, finished with a little lemon juice.\n\n- a sort of turkey-chili type recipe. Turkey, fresh tomato's, Bell peppers, garlic, onion, jalapenos, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper. Then every time I heat a bowl I mash up some avocado and mix it in.\n\nI don't drink and soft drinks, ever. I have them up ~12 years ago and they honestly gross me out at this point.\n\nI drink tea with vanilla flavored, unsweetened almond milk. I prefer tea over coffee but I pretty occasionally drink cappuccinos too.\n\nI try to avoid as much sugar and simple carbs (bread, rice) as possible. And I try to maximize the vegetables that I eat.\n\nFor alcohol I drink bourbon or those low-sugar Seltzer's (like truly and white claw).  Neither drink is perfect but they're the best I've found.\n\nI don't do any calorie counting and generally I eat when I'm hungry and I eat until I'm full. I try not to eat the instant I get hungry, but I don't usually put it off too long.\n\nI do find that getting good at predicting how much food I need to feel full helps a lot. Making the correct amount of food helps. If I make too little I go back for a second serving. If I make too much I usually eat it. Since I usually eat similar amounts per meal every day I just eventually got good at estimating.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m 6&#39; 0&quot; and 160 lbs.</p>\n\n<p>I eat mostly &quot;whole foods&quot;.
