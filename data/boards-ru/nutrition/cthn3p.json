И результаты - опубликованные в двух статьях - в основном разочаровывают.\n\n«Оба исследования были отрицательными», - говорит доктор Лоуренс Файн, руководитель отдела клинического применения и профилактики Национального института сердца, легких и крови, входящего в состав Национального института здоровья, который финансировал исследования.\n\n«В целом они показали, что ни рыбий жир, ни витамин D на самом деле не снижают заболеваемость сердечными заболеваниями или раком», - говорит Файн.\n\nРезультаты были представлены на научных сессиях Американской ассоциации кардиологов в Чикаго и опубликованы в субботу в Медицинском журнале Новой Англии. Одна статья была посвящена добавкам витамина D, а другая - рыбьему жиру.\n\nВ исследованиях приняло участие около 26 000 здоровых взрослых в возрасте 50 лет и старше, у которых в анамнезе не было рака или сердечных заболеваний, которые приняли участие в исследовательском проекте VITAL. Двадцать процентов участников были афроамериканцами.\n\n---------------------------\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944\n\nа также\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1811403","title":"Рыбий жир и добавки Vit D продолжают терпеть неудачу в учебе после учебы.
