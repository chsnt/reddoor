I developed asthma/recurrent pneumonia so step 1 was to quit smoking. I think even beyond that I was mortified that I couldn&#39;t dive under a wave without feeling like I had no air and was drowning. I was 25. Quitting was hard but I just kept trying and kept applying effort, tracking how many I was smoking, aiming for less every day. Busting and beginning again etc. I then decided that alcohol just made me want to smoke so quit drinking too. I found my lungs improve dramatically and wanted to capitalise on it to remind myself to keep going, so I took up running. Running after a &#39;bust&#39; was a good reminder of why I wanted to quit. I was reasonably healthy already diet-wise, but added more raw vegetables and water into the mix so that I could just put stuff in my mouth when I wanted to smoke (ha!) without turning into the side of a house.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>10 years on and I still don&#39;t smoke or drink. I&#39;ve picked it up a few times but just started quitting again immediately - I haven&#39;t gone anywhere near it for at least 5 years now because the lived experience of how that plays out is pretty well etched into my brain. I found piggy-backing the healthy changes motivating and a good distraction from cravings. </p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/aqm9il/what_were_some_of_the_first_changes_you_made_when/eghok00/","name":"t1_eghok00","created":1550213170,"created_utc":1550184370,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_aqm9il","id":"eghpr0k","author":"TheRealMaxWanks","parent_id":"t3_aqm9il","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"More water.
