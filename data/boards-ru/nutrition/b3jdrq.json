I'd recommend making changes in phases.\n\n The first phase I'd go with is getting some fiber and nutrients in. This is great because you can just add stuff in instead of making a bunch of changes. A nice starting point for most people is to make sure that at least half of your plate is filled with produce.  You can make fruit salad and veggie combos twice per week to keep in the fridge and scoop from. For fruit salad, just use whatever is cheap.  Same for veg but some of my favorite combos: \n\nCucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, Bell pepper, black olives\n\nZucchini, eggplant, mushrooms (pre roast or just microwave before eating)\n\nCarrots, broccoli, cauliflower (they make a frozen mix like this called \"California mix\")\n\nYou can eat these plain, toss in your favorite sauces, use in a sandwich with bean paste, throw in a wrap, etc.\n\n\nThe next thing would be to try to make your grains whole grains whenever possible. So look at the ingredients on bread and whatnot. You're starting out so you don't need to get crazy with it. Just aim for more whole grains. There is whole grain bread, English muffins, pasta, pitas, tortillas, etc. Corn is considered a whole grain too!\n\n\nI think protein is where you want to switch carefully. People are attached to their protein and when they don't like it they often quit! You eat meat and dairy, so maybe start the switch to leaner things. Most deli ham isn't bad for saturated fats, it's just got a ton of sodium and crap. But if it's a good crutch then use it when you need it. \n\nCanned beans are so convenient. I like to mash them and use them in sandwiches, wraps, etc. You can also make them into burgers and whatnot but that's maybe next level. I got my husband used to eating different kinds of beans by serving them with a little seasoning and chopped chicken or ham. That might help you too.   \n\nThe classic beans and rice dishes eaten around the world is classic for a reason. You can make up a huge amount for the week and season as you see fit. If you get bored look keep bean recipes from random countries. There's a lot of ideas out there.\n\n\nSo if I were starting out, I might have the following approach:\n\nBreakfasts: oatmeal, fruit smoothie with some protein (tofu, egg whites, white beans)\n\nSnacks: cold fruit salad, cold veggie salad, whole wheat crackers and seasoned bean dip\n\nLunches: whole wheat quesadillas (you can actually just used mashed pinto or black beans and some veggies seasoned with taco spices), roasted veggie wraps with chickpeas, hummus sandwiches with fresh herbs, big salads with garlic toast\n\nDiners: red beans and rice, black beans with rice and plantains, soups like split pea or lemon lentil. \n\nSorry this was so long! If you want any specific recipes let me know what sounds good and I'll tell you how I make it. \n\nAlso, I find its really helpful to keep a can of pull tab beans, a packet of pre cooked rice or quinoa (there are generics of the Uncle Ben's stuff now), and canned veggies on hand. At home or in the car on the run, I can quickly drain and mix that stuff for a decent meal healthier than fast food.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ok cool!
