Некоторые климатические условия станут слишком жаркими для того, что сейчас выращивают фермеры. В некоторых климатических условиях будет больше наводнений, снега и влаги в воздухе, что также ограничит возможности выращивания.\n\nВ отчете установлено, что количественно пищевое питание также может снизиться. Например, пшеница, выращенная с высоким содержанием углекислого газа, будет давать на 6-13% меньше белка, на 4-7% меньше цинка и на 5-8% меньше железа, согласно экспериментам, проведенным с этими растениями.\n«Мы изучаем, как это отразится на пище, которую мы едим, а также на различных культурах, и мы видим схожие результаты», - сказала одна из авторов доклада, Синтия Розенцвейг, старший научный сотрудник Института космоса имени Годдарда при НАСА. Исследования, где она возглавляет Группу по климатическим воздействиям.","title":"Отчет ООН: Климатический кризис делает еду менее питательной, более дефицитной и более дорогой.
