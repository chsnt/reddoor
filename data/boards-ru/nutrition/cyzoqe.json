So, whenever I ear something sugary I restrict myself from eating anything that contains sugar for at least 4 weeks. And usually after 2 weeks I do not crave anything sugary.\n\nI realised that when I keep eating more sugary stuff I crave more sugary stuff. It is really addictive. Try making small changes first. Like, if you drink 4 cans of soda a day make it 2 or even 1 if possible. And one day stop eating/drinking anything that contains sugar. You will definitely feel better.  For example, I haven’t had a soda for the past 7 years. I only tried coke once after 1 year I stopped drinking and it tasted really horrible. \n\nIn the end you have to find what suits you best. Every person is different and has different needs.",
