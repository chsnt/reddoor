{"subreddit":{"display_name":"nutrition"},"subreddit_loc":"питание","selftext":"Это был [ответ, который я сделал ранее] (https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/azyrq3/how_i_felt_using_those_meal_delivery/eibigwi/), но в основном его игнорировали. Я думал, что поделюсь здесь также в случае, если кто-то найдет это полезным.\n\nПо сути, мы с женой занимаемся планированием еды BlueApron / HomeChef, но мы делаем это с помощью нескольких приложений. Самое приятное в этом то, что мы не доставляем еду по всей стране, мы покупаем ее в наших местных продуктовых магазинах, но доставляем ее к нам домой.\n\n& # X200B;\n\nОн включает в себя два приложения (примечание: я не связан ни с одним из этих приложений)\n\n* [Mealime] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealime-meal-plans-recipes/id1079999103?mt=8) - это отличный рецепт приложения; это позволяет вам планировать свои блюда, фильтровать рецепты по вашим личным предпочтениям в еде - вы можете указать низкоуглеводную, кето, палео, вегетарианскую, флекситаристскую и т. д. - вы можете даже перечислить ингредиенты, которые вам не нравятся или у которых есть аллергия. Все рецепты высокого качества, красиво сфотографированы и легко читаются. Самое главное, он позволяет вам загрузить свой список покупок в Instacart, что приводит меня ко второму приложению.\n* [Instacart] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacart/id545599256?mt=8) - заказывайте продукты в местных продуктовых магазинах и * доставляйте их в тот же день *. Таким образом, вместо того, чтобы выбирать еду и отправлять продукты со всей страны, вы просто заказываете в магазинах, которые, возможно, уже совершали покупки. Я полагаю, что либо плата за доставку, либо вы можете подписаться на 99 долларов в год (в этом случае любой заказ свыше 35 долларов бесплатный). В любом случае, это, вероятно, дешевле, чем любой из вариантов домашнего шеф-повара.\n\nИтак, когда мы планируем нашу еду на неделю, все это входит в Instacart. Затем мы вынимаем то, что у нас уже есть, и нажимаем кнопку заказа. Обычно он прибывает к нашей двери через час или два. Намного дешевле, удобнее и быстрее, чем другие услуги по приготовлению еды.\n\n& # X200B;\n\nРЕДАКТИРОВАТЬ: [Проверить наличие Instacart в вашем регионе] (https://www.instacart.com/grocery-delivery).","title":"Как мы с женой делаем нашу версию «BlueApron», но дешевле и из местных продуктовых магазинов","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","ups":413,"created":1552605407,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"b11j0q","author":{"name":"strong_grey_hero"},"permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/b11j0q/how_my_wife_and_i_do_our_version_of_blueapron_but/","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b11j0q/how_my_wife_and_i_do_our_version_of_blueapron_but/","created_utc":1552576607,"replies":[{"ups":78,"link_id":"t3_b11j0q","replies":[{"ups":2,"link_id":"t3_b11j0q","id":"eimw9bm","author":"cre8ngjoy","parent_id":"t1_eimle7n","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"That is a good point that I had not considered.
