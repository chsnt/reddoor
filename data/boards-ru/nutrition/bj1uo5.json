Blueberries, salmon, kale and acai are just a few examples of foods that have garnered the &quot;superfood&quot; label.<br/>\nHowever, <strong>there are no set criteria for determining what is and what is not a superfood</strong>, according to the American Heart Association. &quot;Superfoods don&#39;t have their own food group,&quot; said Despina Hyde, a registered dietician with the weight management program at New York University&#39;s Langone Medical Center. &quot;As a dietician, I think &#39;superfood&#39; is more of a marketing term for foods that have health benefits.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Superfoods contain a variety of nutrients</strong>, such as antioxidants, which are thought to ward off cancer. They also have healthy fats, thought to prevent heart disease; fiber, thought to prevent diabetes and digestive problems; and phytochemicals — the chemicals in plants responsible for deep colors and smells, which can have numerous health benefits. Consuming foods that are packed with nutrients (as many so-called superfoods are) is certainly a good idea.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/bj1uo5/what_cheap_very_very_healthy_food_some_would_say/exnwiv2/","name":"t1_exnwiv2","created":1566493860,"created_utc":1566465060,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":-1,"link_id":"t3_bj1uo5","replies":[{"ups":3,"link_id":"t3_bj1uo5","id":"em50vqc","author":"igz-","parent_id":"t1_em4ujas","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"oh! did not thought about availability, here both liver and brain are dirty cheap ( 1,20 usd for a brain,  $2.00 for a kg of iver) Ï'm actually going to eat some brain right now!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>oh! did not thought about availability, here both liver and brain are dirty cheap ( 1,20 usd for a brain,  $2.00 for a kg of iver) Ï&#39;m actually going to eat some brain right now!</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/bj1uo5/what_cheap_very_very_healthy_food_some_would_say/em50vqc/","name":"t1_em50vqc","created":1556662607,"created_utc":1556633807,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":2}],"id":"em4u1yz","author":"igz-","parent_id":"t3_bj1uo5","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"chicken liver, cow brain and liver, eggs","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>chicken liver, cow brain and liver, eggs</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/bj1uo5/what_cheap_very_very_healthy_food_some_would_say/em4u1yz/","name":"t1_em4u1yz","created":1556657492,"created_utc":1556628692,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":-5,"link_id":"t3_bj1uo5","replies":[{"ups":3,"link_id":"t3_bj1uo5","id":"em5here","author":"GroovyGrove","parent_id":"t1_em4s3ol","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"Oh, come on, salmon roe is only about $60/lb.
