It all depends on how you want to live your life. And I'm not one of these people who will tell you how to live it. But I can't stand silent when people say they're having more fun and achieving more out of life just by indulging their vices or acting casual, when I'm either kicking life's butt or trying really hard to do it.\n\nWe all hear and read scientific discoveries on how just a few weeks or days of unhealthy lifestyle can make noticeable changes on you. Not just food but sleep as well. How it all can increase various diseases, and increase or decrease a risk of death. I know how too much sugar is unhealthy. And alcohol, and millions of other things. If you throw all of it away you may find that big part of fun is missing. Some people would say jokingly \"well if you throw away all the bad stuff then how you're going to die then?\" Lol good joke, but excuse me but I don't want to die any time soon, and I want to be healthy, and if it means a few annoyances and sacrifices, if it means finding new circles of friends and new hurdles to overcome, then so be it. \n\nI'll survive, because that's the way I want to live, that's \"my way\" besides whether it's fun or not, I create my own fun, and my own life road.
