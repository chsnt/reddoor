I have multiple sets of cousins and friends who are in decent shape, but somehow have very overweight kids.  Should we do something about this?  Do pediatricians recommend specific diets and calorie restrictions for parents to put their kids on?

I am not one for government overreach, but is there something we can do to turn this trend around?</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/cb2y57/us_obesity_rate_is_currently_40_but_experts/etcu40a/","name":"t1_etcu40a","created":1562721475,"created_utc":1562692675,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":11,"link_id":"t3_cb2y57","id":"etd50o0","author":"Fleet_of_Foot","parent_id":"t3_cb2y57","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"I'm on vacation in Florida and from what I'm seeing at the pool and the beach, it's already over half of Americans.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m on vacation in Florida and from what I&#39;m seeing at the pool and the beach, it&#39;s already over half of Americans.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/cb2y57/us_obesity_rate_is_currently_40_but_experts/etd50o0/","name":"t1_etd50o0","created":1562728078,"created_utc":1562699278,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":9,"link_id":"t3_cb2y57","id":"ete9b9h","author":"Ferryboat25","parent_id":"t3_cb2y57","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"It is going to be just like the population in Wall-e.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It is going to be just like the population in Wall-e.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/cb2y57/us_obesity_rate_is_currently_40_but_experts/ete9b9h/","name":"t1_ete9b9h","created":1562755081,"created_utc":1562726281,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":25,"link_id":"t3_cb2y57","id":"etcrmiy","author":"WolfofAnarchy","parent_id":"t3_cb2y57","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"We live in a consumerist, hedonist and materialistic society where money, pleasure and YOU come first in everything.
