She is very devoted to her self evolution/growth. </p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/apklmk/who_is_the_healthiest_person_you_know_and_what/eg9rj92/","name":"t1_eg9rj92","created":1549961259,"created_utc":1549932459,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":0},{"ups":149,"link_id":"t3_apklmk","replies":[{"ups":48,"link_id":"t3_apklmk","replies":[{"ups":28,"link_id":"t3_apklmk","id":"eg9pk7e","author":"StoppedLurking_ZoeQ","parent_id":"t1_eg9paap","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"I'm more of a polar guy.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m more of a polar guy.</p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/apklmk/who_is_the_healthiest_person_you_know_and_what/eg9pk7e/","name":"t1_eg9pk7e","created":1549959815,"created_utc":1549931015,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":4}],"id":"eg9p469","author":"StoppedLurking_ZoeQ","parent_id":"t1_eg9mr9w","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"You said it, knowledge is power.\n\n*drinks bear*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You said it, knowledge is power.</p>\n\n<p><em>drinks bear</em></p>\n</div>","permalink":"/r/nutrition/comments/apklmk/who_is_the_healthiest_person_you_know_and_what/eg9p469/","name":"t1_eg9p469","created":1549959491,"created_utc":1549930691,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nutrition","depth":2}],"id":"eg96pq9","author":"bjorken22","parent_id":"t3_apklmk","subreddit_id":"t5_2qoox","body":"TBH, since we're all in this sub, were probably healthier than most others we know.
