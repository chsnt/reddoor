However, their chronic use results in tolerance and dependence, and abrupt cessation of them can lead to death through withdrawal seizures.\n\nAshwagandha is a plant long known to possess anxiolytic effects, in both rodents and humans. It seems to act through the modulation of GABA receptors, in part, which raised a question - can it lead to tolerance and dependence like classical benzodiazepine anxiolytics?\n\nThis study compared Withaferin A (WA; a major active compound in Ashwagandha) to Valium (Diazepam; a prescription benzodiazepine) in rats. It was found that, with sub-chronic use, Diazepam's anxiolytic effects weakened, which required higher doses for the same decrease in anxiety. However, with Ashwagandha, not only there was no tolerance to the anxiolytic effect, there was even *reverse tolerance* - an increase in the strength of the anxiolytic effect over time.","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6pd1ie/","name":"t1_f6pd1ie","created":1573082369,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":0},{"ups":54,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","replies":[{"ups":3,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","replies":[{"ups":2,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","id":"f6w1ph3","author":"KravMagaRengar","parent_id":"t1_f6tjlit","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"Qyay at 1 month they was teleporting themselve","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6w1ph3/","name":"t1_f6w1ph3","created":1573241472,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":4}],"id":"f6tiz3d","author":"KravMagaRengar","parent_id":"t1_f6rtag5","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"Yeah, 10g ksm66.

They made an extract with a quantifiable amount of Withaferin A. They then gave between 10 and 40mg/kg of Withaferin A to the rats, which would be equivalent to about 3 grams of Withaferin A for a human. KSM-66, touted as one of the best commercial extracts, has \"less than\" 0.6 **mg** Withaferin A per dose (that's 0.0006 g, or 0.02%, two hundredths of one percent of the doses in the study).\n\ntl;tl;dr: **The doses of KSM-66 we use are equivalent to two hundredths of one percent of the doses used in this study.**\n\nedit: I'm going to respond here to the attempts below to discredit this post:\n\nOne user attempts to discredit this post by inventing a false claim that Ixoreal, the manufacturer of KSM-66 \"deliberately extract almost all of the Withaferin A on purpose\". This is patently false. Ixoreal makes no such claim. Read [here](https://ksm66ashwagandhaa.com/ashwagandha/how-to-pick-your-ashwagandha-supplier/) for their actual statement, which, by the way, they don't support with any evidence, so take even that with a grain of salt.\n\nAnother argument made is that I failed to adjust for the rat:human dose equivalency. Adjusting for the [HED of a rat dose](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/) brings the value up to .125%. That's one tenth of one percent of the doses used in this study. This is inconsequential .\n\nAnother argument relies on the false premise that withanolides and Withaferin A are the same thing. They are not. Not by a long shot. There are many chemical differences. For one, [unlike other withanolides, Withaferin A is highly reactive](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295212005837) because of the ketone-containing unsaturated A ring, the epoxide in the B ring, and the unsaturated lactone ring.","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6pl3gt/","name":"t1_f6pl3gt","created":1573087527,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":0},{"ups":3,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","id":"f6pp05v","author":"sonambule","parent_id":"t3_dshpg0","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"I have a bottle sitting here but havenâ€™t tried it because I was reading it can cause thyroid issues.

Congratulations to you, personal experiences are much closer to the truth than some tests on lab rats or some old study paper, but this idiotic attitude is prevelant here 'give me links to studies on rats because I only believe science! I don't care what actual users report time after time'\n\nThe whole culture of noots and biohacking began with people sharing their first hand experiences with stacks and supps.\n\nI will take firsthand experience every day before trusting some bs study paper. But you do you.","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6rpilv/","name":"t1_f6rpilv","created":1573143039,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":4}],"id":"f6qqole","author":"oklujay","parent_id":"t1_f6qprsm","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"I've seen it reported here a few times, it supposedly increases testosterone and can lead to earlier onset of male pattern baldness, others said is messes up with thyroid.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7mlvli/ashwagandha_ksm66_is_causing_my_hair_to_fall_out\n\nhttp://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/56290-hair-loss-ashwagandha-bacopa-monnieri-rhodiola/","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6qqole/","name":"t1_f6qqole","created":1573112293,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":2}],"id":"f6qof4p","author":"oklujay","parent_id":"t3_dshpg0","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"And prolonged use leads to hair loss, so not sure what would I choose, probably benzo and have it at least work, not placebo and hair loss.","permalink":"/r/Nootropics/comments/dshpg0/ashwagandha_has_reverse_tolerance_unlike/f6qof4p/","name":"t1_f6qof4p","created":1573110717,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Nootropics","depth":0},{"ups":-8,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","replies":[{"ups":1,"link_id":"t3_dshpg0","id":"f6xbt4h","author":"jimmyjamespresents","parent_id":"t1_f6qmt27","subreddit_id":"t5_2r81c","body":"no because I discontinued for a couple weeks and started taking again.
